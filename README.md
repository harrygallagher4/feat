Create artist graphs based on features. 

## About

My goal with this project is to create 'seamless' playlists based on artist features. I got a little side tracked so right now instead of actually doing something it displays a graph of the artists. It looks pretty cool, I'd have to recommend running it with your own artists.

Feature information comes from Spotify, sorry if you get your music elsewhere. This project is probably best suited to rap artists, because they tend to feature each other a lot and you can create cool graphs.

## Installation

TODO. Basically you need to clone, install via npm, and run gulp. If that doesn't work sorry, I'll update this later. There's a config file in src/api/
